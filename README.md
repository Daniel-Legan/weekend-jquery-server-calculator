# PROJECT NAME

Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

For our week 7 weekend challenge, we were given the task to develop a calculator to collect user inputs and send them to a server. The server should keep the history of user inputs. The server will also send back to the client the history of calculations. The client will update its state and render it to the DOM.

## Usage

1. Enter two numbers in the input fields and select the math operation to be done to them.
2. Press '=' to receive the solution from the server. A list of previous solutions will be displayed below the most recent answer.
3. Press 'C' to clear the input fields and select another math operation.


## Built With

Visual Studio Code, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Express.

## Acknowledgement

I want to thank Rider for helping me figure out how to create a new object from the array history on the server.
